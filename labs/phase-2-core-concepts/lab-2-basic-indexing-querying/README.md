# Lab 2: Basic Indexing and Querying

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

This lab demonstrates the most fundamental search engine operations: indexing a document and then retrieving it with a basic query. You will perform this on all three platforms to see the similarities and differences in their APIs.

## ðŸš€ **How to Run**

1.  **Navigate to the lab directory:**
    ```bash
    cd labs/phase-2-core-concepts/lab-2-basic-indexing-querying
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x run-lab.sh
    ```

3.  **Execute the lab script:**
    ```bash
    ./run-lab.sh
    ```

## âœ… **Expected Outcome**

The script will first index a new document into Elasticsearch, Solr, and OpenSearch. It will then execute a search query on each platform to retrieve the document it just indexed. The output will display the indexed document from the search results of each platform, confirming that basic indexing and querying are working correctly.
