# ======================== OpenSearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: OpenSearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before tweaking these settings, make sure you understand what they do.
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
cluster.name: opensearch-cluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node, which will be used in logging output:
#
node.name: opensearch-node1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate from the installation directory):
#
path.data: /usr/share/opensearch/data
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /usr/share/opensearch/logs
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default, OpenSearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
# By default, OpenSearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port starting
# from 9200. Set a specific port by uncommenting the following line:
#
#http.port: 9200
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["opensearch-node2", "opensearch-node3"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes: ["opensearch-node1", "opensearch-node2", "opensearch-node3"]
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
action.destructive_requires_name: true

# Disable security plugin for learning environment
plugins.security.disabled: true
